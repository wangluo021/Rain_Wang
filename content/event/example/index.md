summary: A presentation was given for investigating thermoplastic prepreg bending under high temperature by Dynamic Mechanical Analysis.
abstract: 'A new characterization technique for investigating the bending behavior of thin-ply thermoplastic prepreg using Dynamic Mechanical Analysis (DMA) is developed with customized 4-point bending fixture, and compared with a test method that uses a rheometer and was previously developed by Convergent. Toray TC1225 LM PAEK thermoplastic prepreg was used in both methods to study the bending-relaxation behavior of the material at different temperatures and loading rates.'
